# CS5103-Project

Big Number Computation-Nicholas Ward

This project computes problems involving two very large numbers. Current computation features include addition and subtraction, as well as adding commas to the result

All functions are located within the CS5103.py Python file. The tests cases are located in testCases.py
Functions include:
BigNumberComputation, which computes the numbers using either addition or subtraction
Test Case 1: adds two very large numbers
Test Case 2: subtracts two very large numbers
Test Case 3: uses incorrect operand, should throw an error
Test Case 4: sees if the result of a computation contains commas

If not already, the decimal library should be imported
